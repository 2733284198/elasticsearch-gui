Please do not use this yet, it is very basic stuff and very much work in progress.

If you do feel adventurous, copy this to the plugin folder of your elasticsearch installation in a folder with your
chosen name and within that folder _site. Than you can browse to:
 http://<server>:<port>/_plugin/<the_name>/index.html

 That should do the trick. If you have questions or problems, use the ticket system.
